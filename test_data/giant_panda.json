    "Giant Panda" : {
        "description": "The modern giant panda, Ailuropoda melanoleuca, is an iconic bear with its distinctive black-and-white fur, powerful jaws, and a specialized thumb-like wrist bone. Native to the mountainous bamboo forests of central China, it has evolved unique adaptations for a near-exclusive bamboo diet, including strong molars and an elongated digestive tract suited for processing plant material. Despite these herbivorous traits, the giant panda belongs to the bear family, Ursidae, and shares common ancestry with omnivorous bears, making its dietary specialization a rare example of evolutionary adaptation.",
